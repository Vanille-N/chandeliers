Tests that we want
    - syntax
        empty inputs, empty outputs, empty locals
        missing punctuations and other missing symbols
        inserted punctuation
        unclosed delimiters
    - typechecking
        invalid in const context
        tuples incompatible size
        tuples incompatible type
        tuples incompatible size, but hidden by function call
        tuples incompatible type, but hidden by function call
        tuple + scalar
        tuple = scalar
        tuple == tuple
        tuple == scalar
        scalar + tuple
        scalar = tuple
        bool = float
        bool + float
        bool == float
        call with bad arguments
        builtin with bad arguments
        no such node
        no such variable
        no such global
        assignment to global
        assignment from global
    - causality
        cycle
        big cycle
        autodep
        missing spec
        redefinition
            - node twice
            - global twice
            - variable twice (in several positions of input/output/local)
            - variable shadows global
            - variable compat global
            - variable compat node
            - node compat global
    - positivity
        pre at the root
        pre too shallow
        pre in fby
            (but also check that we can do "fib = 0 fby 1 fby fib + pre fib"
